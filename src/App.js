      Microeconomists use the word, ‘economic welfare,’ to describe the output
      by efficiency or productivity (income/hour)/home of Supply and Labor
      (Demand), all else in a market being dead-weight-box of a lower quality
      and less partial consumers setting price, like a price control when supply
      already equates demand (x-axis is literally economic-welfare, that I’ve
      likened to enumerate as [productive-]efficiency,{" "}

      Vulgar socialism (and from it in turn a section of the democrats) has
      taken over distribution as production[, not productive-ward]. After the

      Communism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the products of
      society; all that it does is to deprive him of the power to subjugate the
